## Getting Started
To run the tool navigate into `client/`.
Then run `npm install` followed by `npm run`.

You should then be greeted with the tool in your installed browser of choice. 
The tool should work with all modern browsers but was only tested within Firefox,
so your mileage may vary.

For using this tool you'll need a _.csv_ file where each line contains a value for all of your recorded channels.
The csv file cannot have a header, channel names will be generated from the index of the column (starting with `Channel 0`).

One line will later correspond to 1/10th of a second in playback
(which is not variable for now).

You can then load your csv file via the pink fab-button on the right side of the screen.

After loading you can move the channel markers onto the brain to whichever position you feel sensible.
The channel markers are identifiable over the 3 character code which associates them with a channel.

While playing you can move the microphone around to experience the sounds generated by the tool in a spacial manner.
